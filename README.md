# Communication-Research-with-Machine-Learning

This repository contains four interdisciplinary(communication and computer science) projects I have done in my Research Assistant Career in Boston University.

Most of the project are related to exploring meaning of big data(social media data like tweets and news articles) using machine learnning technics.

Election Project: 
(1)predict tweet sentiment towards presidential candidate 
(2)Design and implement a crowd-working platform which can optimally assign work and collect labels as input for larger scale machine learning system especially neural network

Meaner on Mobile Project:
(1)study the behavior of tweet users about their use of impolite words on different platforms.
(2)design a automatic classifier to detect 'impoliteness' in tweet by combining dictionary-based search and machine detection.

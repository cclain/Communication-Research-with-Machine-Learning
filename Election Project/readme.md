In this Project, I used labeled tweet data(three sentiments: positive, neutral and negative) for presidential candidates(Hillary, Cruz, Berni, Trump) sentiment classification.

Then, we designed a optimal crowd-working platform for train data collection which can be used as input for later stage large scale machine learning system like neural network.
